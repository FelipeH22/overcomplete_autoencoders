# overcomplete_autoencoders
Autoencoder using CNN and the approach of an autoencoder whose hidden layers are "bigger" than the input, the decoder takes that bigger image and transform it into the original one. In this case, two models are created, the first one, with Conv2DTranpose layers and the second one with Conv2D
